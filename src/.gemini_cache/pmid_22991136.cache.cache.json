The chromosomal phase could be determined for patient AII-11 (Family A).\n*   Comparison of AII-11's haplotype with other mutation carriers (BIII-8, CII-3, D) indicated different genotypes at a locus near VPS35 (D16S3105), suggesting at least 3 independent mutational events or founders for the p.D620N mutation in the Japanese patients studied. While AII-11 and BIII-8 might share a common founder, this was inconclusive.\n*   Patient AII-11's clinical features (onset at age 62, tremor-predominant PD, development of cognitive dysfunction after 15 years) contributed to the study's overall finding that patients with the VPS35 mutation showed typical tremor-predominant PD, which could include late-stage dementia. His brain MRI and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy were normal.",
    "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the family ID?": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nThe family ID for patient 'AII-11' is **A**.\n\nThis is indicated in Figure 1, where patient AII-11 is shown in pedigree A, and confirmed in the text on page 4 which states: \"We were able to determine the chromosomal phase only in patient AII-11 (family A).\"",

Patient D developed upper limb rest tremor at age 42 and had no family history of Parkinson's Disease (PD), leading to a categorization as Sporadic PD (SPD). At age 60, Patient D underwent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) due to disabling motor fluctuation and dyskinesia refractory to pharmacological treatment. Patient D was born to nonconsanguineous parents. Haplotype analysis suggested that the p.D620N mutation in Patient D likely occurred independently compared to the mutations found in families A/B and C within the study. Clinical features included tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait disturbance, postural instability, response to levodopa with wearing off, asymmetry at onset, orthostatic hypotension, incontinence, urinary urgency, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
