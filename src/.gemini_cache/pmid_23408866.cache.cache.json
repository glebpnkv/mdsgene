While it details genetic findings and sometimes Age at Onset (AAO) or family history for specific variant carriers (e.g., individuals with p.R1205H, p.E787K, p.Y507F), it does not designate any specific individual as 'Patient 1'.

The only mention of a relevant non-motor symptom is 'dementia' observed in individual II.1 of the p.R1205H family pedigree (Figure 2), but this individual is not identified as 'Patient 1' and had an \"unclear\" PD diagnosis.
