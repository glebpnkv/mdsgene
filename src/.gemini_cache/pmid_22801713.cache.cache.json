Longitudinal follow-up over 13 years showed disease progression from Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 to 3. Developed motor fluctuations with peak-dose dyskinesias and \"off\" state gait impairment/freezing. Also developed restless legs syndrome at age 46 and impulse control behaviors (hypersexuality, pathological gambling) in the last 5 years (attributed to dopamine-agonist therapy). Showed good clinical response to levodopa treatment.\n*   **Clinical Examination (at age 60):** Showed rigidity, rest tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability, motor fluctuations, and profuse hyperhidrosis. No oculomotor, cerebellar, or corticospinal signs.\n*   **Cognitive/Other:** Had evidence of mild cognitive impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA score 23/30) at age 60, chiefly affecting memory, although his Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score remained normal (29/30). Olfaction was severely impaired (10th percentile on UPSIT). No psychiatric diagnosis on SCID.\n*   **Neuroimaging:** Transcranial sonography did not reveal substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (left normal, right insufficient window). Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were normal.\n*   **Family History:** Consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Affected father (II:1), paternal aunt (II:4, also a mutation carrier), paternal uncle (II:3), and grandfather (I:1). Had 6 reportedly unaffected siblings, 3 of whom (III:4, III:6, III:8) were found to carry the mutation.\n*   **Genetics:** Carries the heterozygous p.D620N mutation.

Since the proband inherited the mutation from his father (II:1), the DNA-level mutation for patient II:1 is the same as that identified in the proband.\n\nTherefore, the DNA-level mutation for patient 'II:1' is **c.1858G>A**.",
    "Regarding patient 'II:1': What is the protein-level effect of the mutation?": "Information not found.\n\nRationale: The document identifies patient II:1 as the father of the proband (III:2). It states that II:1 developed PD and dementia (Page 2, Right Column, Paragraph 4). The pedigree figure (Page 3) shows II:1 as affected (filled symbol) and deceased (slashed symbol). However, the figure does not provide any genetic testing results (like M/wt status or haplotype data) for patient II:1, unlike other tested family members (e.g., III:2, II:4). While the pattern of inheritance suggests II:1 likely carried the mutation, the document does not explicitly state that patient II:1 was tested and confirmed to carry the p.D620N mutation. Therefore, based *only* on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the protein-level effect of the mutation *in patient II:1*.",

    "Regarding patient 'II:3': Number of mutation-negative and unaffected family members?": "Information not found.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The document identifies patient II:3 as the paternal uncle of the proband (III:2) and states that II:3 received a diagnosis of PD (Page 2, paragraph starting \"The patient has 6 siblings...\"). This means II:3 is *affected*, not unaffected.\n2.  The document describes genetic analysis performed on the extended family (Page 2, same paragraph; Page 3, Figure). It explicitly states that the affected paternal aunt (II:4) and 3 reportedly unaffected siblings of the proband (III:4, III:5, III:6) were found to be mutation carriers.\n3.  The Figure on Page 3 shows genotypes for several family members. Individuals III:7, III:8, and IV:1 are shown as unaffected (clear symbols) and mutation-negative (wt/wt genotype listed). These individuals are relatives of II:3.\n4.  However, the text describing the genetic analysis results *only* explicitly mentions the positive findings (mutation carriers). It does not explicitly state the number of family members who were tested and confirmed to be *both* mutation-negative *and* unaffected. While the figure *implies* this for III:7, III:8, and IV:1, the narrative text does not provide this specific count or confirm the scope of testing leading to these negative results explicitly.\n5.

    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Who is the first author and what is the publication year?": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe first author is Kishore R. Kumar.\nThe publication year is 2012.",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Any general comments about the study?": "Based on the information contained within the document:\n\nPatient 'I:1' was the paternal grandfather of the mutation carrier (proband III:2). Patient I:1 received a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The pedigree figure indicates that I:1 is deceased. No other general comments about the study regarding patient I:1 are present in the text.",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': What is the family ID?": "Information not found",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': What is the individual ID within the family?": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nThe individual ID for patient 'I:1' within the family is **1**.\n\nThis is indicated in the pedigree chart Figure on page 3, where the generations are labeled with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV) and individuals within each generation are labeled with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3...). The individual in question is labeled 'I:1'.",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Are the parents consanguineous?": "Information not found.",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Is there a family history of the disease?": "Yes, according to the text on page 2, patient I:1 (the proband's grandfather) received a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The text states: \"His paternal uncle (II:3) and grandfather (I:1) have also received a diagnosis of PD.\"",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Number of mutation-negative but affected family members?": "Information not found",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Number of mutation-negative and unaffected family members?": "Information not found.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The document identifies patient 'I:1' as the paternal grandfather of the mutation carrier (proband III:2) on page 2 (\"His paternal uncle (II:3) and grandfather (I:1) have also received a diagnosis of PD.\")\n2.  The pedigree chart on page 3 shows 'I:1' is affected with Parkinson's disease (filled symbol).\n3.  The pedigree chart shows I:1's partner (I:2) and one daughter (II:2) as unaffected (open symbols).\n4.  However, the document does not provide any genetic testing results (mutation status) for individuals I:1, I:2, II:1, II:2, or II:3. Genetic data is only provided for II:4 and generation III.\n5.  Therefore, while we can identify unaffected family members of I:1 (I:2 and II:2) from the pedigree, we cannot determine their mutation status based *only* on the information provided in the document. The question requires both criteria (mutation-negative *and* unaffected) to be met and verifiable within the text.",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': What is the sex of the individual?": "Based on the information in the document:\n\n*   On page 2, the text states: \"His paternal uncle (II:3) and grandfather (I:1) have also received a diagnosis of PD.\" The term \"grandfather\" indicates male sex.\n*   On page 3, the pedigree chart shows individual 'I:1' represented by a square symbol. Standard pedigree notation uses squares to represent males.\n\nTherefore, the sex of the individual 'I:1' is **Male**.",

    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Was the individual alive at last follow-up? (Y/N)": "Based on the pedigree chart (Figure) on page 3 and its accompanying legend, the symbol for individual 'I:1' has a slash through it. The legend states: \"slashed symbols mark deceased relatives.\" Therefore, individual I:1 was deceased.\n\nN",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': What was the disease duration in years?": "Information not found",
    "Regarding patient 'I:1': Did the patient have parkinsonism?": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nOn page 1361 (OCR page 2), in the right-hand column, the text states: \"His paternal uncle (II:3) and grandfather (I:1) have also received a diagnosis of PD.\"\n\nPD stands for Parkinson disease, which is a condition characterized by parkinsonism. Therefore, according to the document, patient I:1 did have parkinsonism.",
