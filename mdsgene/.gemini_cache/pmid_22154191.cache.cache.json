    "Regarding patient 'II-1' from family 'Fig 1 Family': What was the age at onset (AAO) of symptoms for this patient?": "Based on the information provided in the document:\n\nThe pedigree chart in Fig. 1 indicates the age of onset (O:) for individual II-1 as '40s'. Additionally, the text on page 838.e4 states, \"Individual II-1 presented with akinetic-rigid parkinsonism in her late fourth decade\".\n\nTherefore, the age at onset (AAO) for patient 'II-1' is given as **40s** (according to the pedigree label) or **late fourth decade** (according to the text description). Using the pedigree label convention, the AAO is **40s**.",
    "Regarding patient 'II-3' from family 'Fig 1 Family': What was the age at onset (AAO) of symptoms for this patient?": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe pedigree shown in Figure 1 provides information for individual 'II-3'. Below the symbol for II-3, the text reads \"O:70s D:80\". According to the figure legend, \"O:\" indicates the Age of onset.\n\nTherefore, the age at onset (AAO) of symptoms for patient 'II-3' was in their 70s.\n\n*(Note: The text on page 838.e4 states that individuals II-3 and II-5 developed parkinsonism in their seventh decade, which contradicts the information in Figure 1 which labels both II-3 and II-5 with O:70s. However, following the instruction to base the answer *only* on the information provided, the figure explicitly labels II-3 with an onset in the 70s.)*",
