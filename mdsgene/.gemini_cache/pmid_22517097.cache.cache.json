    "Regarding patient 'FPD-142-1' from family 'FPD-142': Number of mutation-negative and unaffected family members?": "Information not found\n\n*Rationale:* The document mentions family FPD-142 and lists three affected members (FPD-142-1, FPD-142-3, FPD-142-6) who carry the D620N mutation (Table 1). The text states, \"Analysis of DNA from relatives in 1 of the 3 families showed that all affected members (n = 3), but not the unaffected individual, carried the mutation\". However, it immediately follows with, \"Segregation analyses were not available for the 2 remaining families.\" Since FPD-142 is one of the three families where the mutation was found, and the text doesn't specify which family underwent the segregation analysis showing an unaffected individual, and explicitly states segregation analysis was *not* available for two families, we cannot determine from this document if family FPD-142 had any tested unaffected members, nor their mutation status.

The text states, \"Mini-Mental State Examination scores for 3/5 patients (disease durations 3–14 years) were normal, indicating the absence of dementia (table 1).\" Since FPD-142-1 is one of the patients listed in Table 1 with an MMSE score (29), the document indicates the absence of dementia, which is information regarding a non-motor symptom.",
    "Regarding patient 'FPD-142-1' from family 'FPD-142': Any autonomic symptoms present?": "Information not found.\n\nRationale: Table 1 lists the \"First symptom\" for patient FPD-142-1 as \"Asymmetric bradykinesia and resting tremor\".

The text describes the screening of the *VPS35* gene and the identification of this mutation in members of the FPD-142 kindred. While other genes (*LRRK2*, *SNCA*, *SCA2*) were checked for exclusion criteria prior to the *VPS35* screening, the document states that *VPS35* was the gene where a pathogenic variant (D620N) was found in this patient as part of this study's findings.\n\nTherefore, the first gene with a pathogenic variant found in patient 'FPD-142-1' according to this document is **VPS35**.",

    "Regarding patient 'FPD-142-1' from family 'FPD-142': What is the third gene with a pathogenic variant found in the patient (if any)?": "Information not found\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  The document focuses on screening for mutations in the *VPS35* gene in French families with Parkinson's Disease.\n2.  It identifies the *VPS35* D620N mutation in 3 families, including FPD-142 (Page 1, Results).\n3.  Table 1 on page 2 lists patient FPD-142-1 as having the *VPS35* D620N mutation.
